Coup
====

The original game is copyrighted by  Rikki Tahta. The game has been modelled based on the original coup card game. The on-line version was developed for fun. 

The original card game was designed to play with 7 players. However, the on-line game only supports two players at the current moment. 

Currently, the game is in beta stage. The game is designed using the following frameworks.

1. jQuery
2. nodeJS, express and socket io
3. bootstrap

The game can be played here (http://coupcardgame.herokuapp.com/).
